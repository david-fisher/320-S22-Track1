 * for easier control of layout (stage: functionality)
 *
 * Grid is used for organizing the elements; it works on the idea that each screen has 12 columns to work with.
 * lg and xl are for large and x-large screens, respectively. They help adjust how many columns the item takes
 * depending on screen size. For our purposes, we assume they only use computer screens and thus only have
 * lg and xl to be specified. - @hiimlo note (feel free to add your own notes)
